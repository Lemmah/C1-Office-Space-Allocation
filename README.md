# Office Space Allocator
### Intro
Office Room Allocator is an app that is designed to allocate rooms at one of Andela's facilities called the Dojo. When a new Fellow joins Andela they are assigned an office space and an optional living space if they choose to opt in. When a new Staff joins they are assigned an office space only. This console application digitizes and randomizes a room allocation system for one of Andela Kenyaâ€™s facilities called The Dojo.
